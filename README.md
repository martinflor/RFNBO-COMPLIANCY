# RFNBO Compliancy Calculator

A Streamlit application for testing RFNBO (Renewable Fuel of Non-Biological Origin) compliance of electrolyser operations based on ENTSOE electricity market data.

## Overview

This application helps determine whether hydrogen produced through electrolysis meets RFNBO compliance requirements by:
- Fetching real-time data from ENTSOE (day-ahead prices, generation mix)
- Calculating the renewable fraction of consumed electricity
- Applying temporal correlation rules (hourly or monthly)
- Implementing the 20% price threshold rule
- Verifying 70% GHG savings requirement

### Application Tabs

The application has two main tabs:

#### 1. 🎯 RFNBO Analysis Tab
- Shows calculated RFNBO compliance results
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Compliance status and key metrics
- Downloadable results

#### 2. 📊 ENTSOE Data Explorer Tab
- View raw ENTSOE data before processing
- **Low-price highlighting**: Rows with prices < 20€/MWh highlighted in orange
- Price distribution charts
- Generation mix by source type
- Statistics and metrics for fetched data
- Download raw data as CSV

### Understanding Results

#### Compliance Status
- ✅ **COMPLIANT**: Overall RFNBO fraction ≥ 70%
- ❌ **NOT COMPLIANT**: Overall RFNBO fraction < 70%

#### Key Metrics
- **Total Consumption**: Total energy consumed by electrolyser (MWh)
- **RFNBO Fraction**: Percentage of consumption that qualifies as RFNBO
- **Avg GHG Savings**: Average greenhouse gas savings vs fossil comparator
- **Compliant Hours**: Percentage of hours meeting compliance threshold

#### Visualizations

1. **RFNBO Fraction Over Time**: Shows temporal variation in RFNBO compliance
2. **Energy Sources**: Stacked area chart showing PPA vs Grid consumption
3. **Price vs Compliance**: Scatter plot showing relationship between electricity prices and compliance
4. **Monthly Summary**: Key statistics for the analyzed period

## RFNBO Compliance Rules

### 1. GHG Savings Requirement
- Minimum 70% GHG savings required
- Fossil comparator: 94 g CO₂eq/MJ
- Renewable electricity: 0 g CO₂eq/MJ

### 2. Energy Sources
- **PPA Energy**: 100% RFNBO (direct renewable contract)
- **Grid Energy**: RFNBO fraction = renewable share in national mix
  - Exception: 100% RFNBO when prices < 20th percentile

### 3. Temporal Correlation
- **Hourly**: Consumption must match renewable production hour-by-hour
- **Monthly**: Consumption can be averaged over the month

## Technical Details

### ENTSOE PSR Types (Generation Sources)

**Renewable Sources (RFNBO-eligible):**
- B09: Geothermal
- B11: Hydro Run-of-river
- B12: Hydro Water Reservoir
- B13: Marine
- B15: Other renewable
- B16: Solar
- B18: Wind Offshore
- B19: Wind Onshore

**Non-Renewable Sources:**
- B01: Biomass
- B02-B08: Fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil, etc.)
- B10: Hydro Pumped Storage
- B14: Nuclear
- B17: Waste
- B20: Other

### Calculation Methodology

1. **Fetch Market Data**: Download day-ahead prices and generation mix from ENTSOE
2. **Calculate Renewable Share**: 
   - Sum renewable generation / Total generation
   - Can be annual average or hourly varying
3. **Apply PPA**: Direct renewable consumption from PPA (100% RFNBO)
4. **Grid Consumption**: 
   - When consumption > PPA, use grid
   - Grid RFNBO = Grid consumption × renewable share
   - If prices < 20th percentile: Grid RFNBO = Grid consumption × 1.0
5. **Calculate Total RFNBO**: PPA RFNBO + Grid RFNBO
6. **Verify Compliance**: Check if GHG savings ≥ 70%

### GHG Savings Formula

```
renewable_fraction = RFNBO_energy / Total_energy
actual_emission = (1 - renewable_fraction) × 94 g CO₂eq/MJ
ghg_savings = (94 - actual_emission) / 94
compliance = ghg_savings ≥ 0.70
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No data available**: 
   - Check ENTSOE API key is set correctly
   - Verify the selected country and date have available data
   - Some countries may not report all data types

2. **Slow data fetching**:
   - ENTSOE API can be slow during peak hours
   - Consider shorter time periods for faster results

3. **Missing generation data**:
   - Not all countries report generation mix to ENTSOE
   - Use manual renewable share input as fallback

## API Key

To get an ENTSOE API key:
1. Register at https://transparency.entsoe.eu/
2. Create an account
3. Request API access through your account settings
4. Set the key as environment variable `ENTSOE_API_KEY`
